This photo was taken in **15 May 2020 at 17:42:00** while I and Gab were waiting for our friend Rabbit, to pick up some sandwiches outside of a mall. By the time, we already had the idea to do graffiti because we found so many T-ups and tags in the town when we were hanging around the city during night times. 
这张照片拍摄于**2020年五月十五号17:42:00**，当时我和Gab正在一家商场外面等Rabbit带给我们的三明治。因为我们晚上在城里瞎逛的时候看到了许多T-ups和tags，所以当时我们已经有玩涂鸦的想法了。

However, the idea was firstly originated from the notorious [Banksy's auction event](https://news.artnet.com/market/banksy-incident-sothebys-street-artists-performance-art-debut-1367071) in 2018; we had plans to do some stencils(some big gold fish) on the streets just like Banksy's works, on the day before my trip to Japan in 2019, and -- shit happened; I twisted my ankle on that day playing basketball :( so the plan was postponed to the next summer.
但是这个想法最早是在2018年[Banksy那个拍卖事件](https://news.artnet.com/market/banksy-incident-sothebys-street-artists-performance-art-debut-1367071)之后产生的。我们想像他的作品一样在街上用模具来做涂鸦（喷一只大金鱼），在19年我打算去日本玩的前一天，我们打算去把金鱼喷了，但是人算不如天算，那天下午打球的时候我把脚崴了 :( 于是这个计划搁置到了下一个暑假。
The word on that sticker is PLUS(our current crew name), a substitution for sandwiches, and it is an interesting word since the Chinese pronunciation of it(加 Jiā) is similar to other words like "home" in Chinese or ["Jah"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jah) in English. I was the one who put the sticker on the steel pipe and you can tell it was not positioned properly because I was a bit nervous.
贴纸上写的是PLUS（我们现在队的名字），这个单词格外有意思是因为它的中文读音（加 Jiā）很像家，而英文读音很像是["Jah"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jah)。贴纸被我贴歪了因为我当时有点紧张。
From that day on, Gab bought some tools like dabbers from online because we were so influenced by the videos on Youtube from [Wekman aka "tag machine"](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2O8UjohA50PY16J2O9311w). And, at the beginning, we were not prepared to write on the street so we tried those tools in a basketball court.
因为我们经常在油管上看[Wekman aka "tag machine"](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2O8UjohA50PY16J2O9311w)的视频，所以从那天之后Gab从网上买了些流淌笔来玩，但是当时我们还不敢上街于是只是在某个篮球场里试这些东西。

- I believe this is one of the first graffiti photos that I took in the town⬆.
- 这是我在城里最早拍下来的涂鸦之一⬆.

We were so dumb to use dabbers on the concrete floor and those dabbers were just ruined. But, at the time, we thought those tags looked so cool and I believe I definitely had a good sleep :)
我们弱智到用流淌笔在水泥地上写字，然后笔头直接被蹭坏了，但是当时我们觉得那些签名很酷，那天我一定是笑着睡着的:)
