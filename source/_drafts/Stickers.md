This time we invited Eryk to join us doing graffiti on the wall. I particularly like the metal effect of my letters because they looked cool. Gab did a shout out to our friend 局长 who shared a good time with us. Eryk did a shark with a knife cutting through its belly. I particularly like the way the colors of my letters sort of connected the other works.

Later that night, after we finished our pieces, Gab gave me the stickers that we made online. There were 2000 stickers in total or something including his, mine, and our crew stickers. 



The other day I just could not sit in my room and I went to the downtown at 8; I knew it is early for graffiti but stickers allowed me to do it fast and clean.
