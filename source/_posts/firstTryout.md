This photo was taken in **15 May 2020 at 17:42:00** while I and Gab were waiting for our friend Rabbit, to pick up some sandwiches outside of a mall. By the time, we already had the idea to do graffiti because we found so many T-ups and tags in the town when we were hanging around the city during night times.

However, the idea was firstly originated from the notorious [Banksy's auction event](https://news.artnet.com/market/banksy-incident-sothebys-street-artists-performance-art-debut-1367071) in 2018; we had plans to do some stencils(some big gold fish) on the streets just like Banksy's works, on the day before my trip to Japan in 2019, and -- shit happened; I twisted my ankle on that day playing basketball :( so the plan was postponed to the next summer.
The word on that sticker is PLUS(our current crew name), a substitution for sandwiches, and it is an interesting word since the Chinese pronunciation of it(加 Jiā) is similar to other words like "home" in Chinese or ["Jah"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jah) in English. I was the one who put the sticker on the steel pipe and you can tell it was not positioned properly because I was a bit nervous.
From that day on, Gab bought some tools like dabbers from online because we were so influenced by the videos on Youtube from [Wekman aka "tag machine"](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2O8UjohA50PY16J2O9311w). And, at the beginning, we were not prepared to write on the street so we tried those tools in a basketball court.

- I believe this is one of the first graffiti photos that I took in the town⬆.

We were so dumb to use dabbers on the concrete floor and those dabbers were just ruined. But, at the time, we thought those tags looked so cool and I believe I definitely had a good sleep :)
