We just could not resist the feeling of releasing the pressure from the cans on the streets -- a mixture of adrenaline and satisfaction so we bought more industrial cans and spray the paints on the walls and many other surfaces. We would ride shared bikes on the 2nd ring road doing simple letters and taking photos of other local writers' works.

- D9 crew love to apply negative spaces to write their crew names so we did something similar⬆.

After doing bombings for some consecutive weeks, we got to know more about graffiti and how to do graffiti. Therefore, we were long for a spot to do some works under daylights and spend time to add more details. And yeah we found an abandoned place in the west side of the city. The entrance was blocked with a shitty mattress and, once we entered the area, there was a sewage ditch on the right side and the left side was overgrown with pricky bushes(you have to wear trousers). We explored the whole area and did some shitty letters in one of the buildings.

Rooftop is absolutely one of the best spots writers could find to do a chill piece so we went to that art supply shop again and spent an afternoon to finish our very first pieces. I still remember how the pedestrians looked at us with strange faces and I kinda enjoyed it and I could not give more shit about anything else while doing that piece.
