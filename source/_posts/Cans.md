We started to do more stickers and tags in different spots and on the baskets of shared bikes(yes we did that). The reason why we were doing the basket thingy was that there are just so many of them and it would not cause any conflicts with others. It can also be considered as a little experiment-- will we ever meet a tagged shared bike on the street again? The answer was no and we tried.

Clearly the sticker and tags were not enough to get the adrenaline flowing and everybody knows that graffiti writers use cans so we wanted to finish that left behind stencil plan. Gab used a projector to locate the places, on the paper, that are needed to cut out (shout out to Gab).
Now we need to consider what type of spray paint cans are we looking for and where can we buy cans. The industrial spray cans are not on the list because they are just too shitty for such relatively dedicated work. So we found an art supply shop and bought some Montana hardcore spray cans for about 30-40 rmb each. Once we got everything, we went to a skate board park at night and executed the mission.
