This time we invited Eryk to join us doing graffiti on the wall. I made the metal-ish effect on my letters because they looked cool. Gab did a shout out to our friend 局长 who shared a good time with us. Eryk did a shark with a knife cutting through its belly. I particularly like the way the colors of my letters sort of connected the other works.

Later that night, after we finished our pieces, Gab gave me the stickers that we made. There were 2000 stickers in total or something. We always wanted to do stickers because, every time we went out, we could spot some stickers in different places and some of them are interesting, due to the interactions with the surroundings, and the others may be concealed in all kinds of places.

- Some stickers that I saw on the streets⬆.
Stickers enabled us to leave our tag or iconic figures on the street faster, in an unobtrusive way. The next day I just could not sit in my room so I went to the downtown at 8; It would be early for bombing but, for stickers, you can do it anytime and nearly anywhere.

- I wish stickers can give people some "a-ha! moments"⬆.
