# Pixels and colors
- The pixel can be considered as function containing the x and y coordinates.
- The function outputs a color represented by a **8-bit number(0-255)**.
- The RGB model indicates three "channels" and each channel indicates a color.
- **PPI** stands "for pixel per inch" 
    - How many pixels along the width(inches) or height(inches).
- The (0,0) of an image in OpenCV is at the **upper left corner**.
# Image processing
- **Paddings** are very useful when some of the letters or digits are too big to find contours.
- **Erosion** is useful to remove noises.
- **Image moment** is a certain particular weighted average (moment) of the image pixels' intensities, or a function of such moments, usually chosen to have some attractive property or interpretation.
